        <h2>History of Energy Storage</h2>
        <h3>Since the dawn of civilizaiton</h3>
      

      <p>
          Energy storage has been around for as long as we know. People would store water 
          underground to keep it at constant temperature. The modern electirc battery was also a mistake.
          It was claimed to produce energy forever at super low voltages of course.
          Captering energy and storing it has also been very closely tied when researching 
          renewable resources. Energy storeage has evolved over the years to capture mlre energy 
          in the smallest area possible. The transporatation of energy is also vital now 
          for current technologies as electric cars are pushing the limits on distance. 
          Damns  for example store enegy by preventing water from slowing. This is also a type 
          of storage. Energy is all around us, without storage however our lives would obviously different.

                Mechanical Energy is stored in kenitic energy such as a flywheel 
                and allows for easy transfer of mechanical energy.

                Thermal energy is energy from temperature difference in materials. 
                Such as hot air or water that is then used transfer energy.

                gravitational energy. 
                Such as moving water to elevated 
                heights until needed.
