        <h2>History of Energy Storage</h2>
        <h3>Since the dawn of civilizaiton</h3>
      

      <p>
          Energy storage has been around for as long as we know. People would store water 
          underground to keep it at constant temperature. The modern electirc battery was also a mistake.
          It was claimed to produce energy forever at super low voltages of course.
          Captering energy and storing it has also been very closely tied when researching 
          renewable resources. Energy storeage has evolved over the years to capture mlre energy 
          in the smallest area possible. The transporatation of energy is also vital now 
          for current technologies as electric cars are pushing the limits on distance. 
          Damns  for example store enegy by preventing water from slowing. This is also a type 
          of storage. Energy is all around us, without storage however our lives would obviously different.

            <h3> Mechanical Energy</h3>
            <p class="card-a">
                Mechanical Energy is stored as kenitic energy in a contraption. Most common and 
                most efficient types of mechanical storage is a flywheel.
                Flywheels store energy in a cylindrical large mass that spins at high speeds.
                Flywheels have the advantage of quick charge and discharge of energy.

            <h3>Chemical Energy</h3>
            <p class="card-a">
                Chemical energy is energy stores in chemical reaction 
                that release electrical energy. Household batteries are found here. Many
                types exits but they all have the same three main components. Two terminals of 
                different materials and the electrolyte which seperates the materials.
                Capacity is the amount of electric energy a battery can hold. Amount of current 
                over a period of time is measured in Amp hour.

            <h3> Thermal Energy</h3>
            <p class="card-a">
                Thermal energy is the storage of energy at above or below ambient temperature.
                There are two types of thermal energy storage based on manner of storage:
                sensible and latent. Sensible thermal energy is  stored by chnaging a temperature in
                a material such as heating up water. Latent thermal energy storage is stored by changing
                the phase of the material such as turning water into ice for later.

            <h3> Other types</h3>
            <p class="card-a">
                Hydropump storage is used when energy is stored in potential
                gravitational energy. 
                An example would be moving water to elevated 
                heights and releasing water to fall and capturing that energy.
                Another type is biological organic where, biomass is produces to store energy.
